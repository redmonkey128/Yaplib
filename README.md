What it is
----------
yaplib is a library of shims to provide easy, conistant access to php resources.  It aims to implement REST routing, simple database connections, and more.  It is not a web framework: it does not provide an orginzational model for your application.  It is inspired from [Epiphany], [expressjs], and a desire to have a simple, consistent php interface for web development.
